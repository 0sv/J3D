            <a name="gettingStarted"></a><h2>What is that?</h2>
			
			<p><b>J3D</b> is a lightweight open-source WebGL engine written in Javascript with an extremly simple API.</p>
			
			<a name="gettingStarted"></a><h2>Getting started</h2>
			
			<p>This quick tutorial will introduce some basic concepts in J3D and show how to create a simple scene.
			No prior webgl experience is required, but a working knowledge of HTML and some Javascript experience 
			may be useful.</p>
			
			<p>Start by grabbing the latest version of the engine and copy the j3d.js file to your working folfer. 
			When done, create a simple HTML document and include the script:</p>
			
			<pre class="brush: xml; class-name: 'syntaxExtras'">
			&lt;html&gt 
			&lt;head&gt 
			&lt;meta http-equiv="content-type" 
				  content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1"&gt 
			&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="j3d.js"/&gt
			&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt
				function init(){
					// The rest of the code will go here
				}
			&lt;/script&gt
			&lt;/head&gt 
			&lt;body onload="init();"&gt
			&lt;/body&gt 
			&lt;/html&gt</pre>
			
			Now, we can start creating a simple 3d scene. Inside the init function, start by initializing the engine.
			This create a canvas element that spans over the whole page and initialize the webgl.

			<pre class="brush: js; first-line: 1">engine = new J3D.Engine();</pre>
			
			<p>Now let's create our 3D first object. Since it's a beginners tutorial, we will make a cube. In J3D, all objects in the 3D space, 
			no matter what they are, are represented by an entity called Transform. A transform is a point in space that
			has a position, a rotation and scale.</p>
			
			<pre class="brush: js; first-line: 2">
			t = new J3D.Transform();
			t.position = new v3(0, 0, 0);</pre>
			
			<p>The following lines define a new transform and set it's position to the center of the coordinate system. 
			The position is defined by a 3 dimensional vector. Since vectors are used very often in 3d programing, the name
			for the vector type is short - simply <b>v3</b>. The vector defines the position along x, y, and z axis respectively.</p>
			
			<p>Traditionaly in 3d systems, the x axis goes from right to left. The y axis goes from bottom to top, 
			and the z axis - from the front "into" the screen. This is quite different that 2d coordinates, where the 0,0 point is in 
			the top-left corner. Because of the an object set at 0,0,0 cordinates will appear in the middle of the screen.</p>
			
			<p>As metionned above, a transform is just a point that has a position in space. It doesn't represent anything visually itself.
			To make a cube we will need to more elements. First one is a 3d model. In J3D a 3d model is called a Mesh.</p>
			
			<pre class="brush: js; first-line: 4">
			t.mesh = new J3D.Mesh(Cube);</pre>
			
			<p>By assigning a new object of type J3D.Mesh to the mesh property of the transform we attach it to the transform. 
			A mesh defines the shape of a 3d object, which in 3d terms is often called geometry.</p>
			
			<p>J3D uses a simple JSON format to store geomtry definitions. It is locarted in the second file we included in the
			HTML code above. Take a look at it, it's basically a list of coordinates (for now don't worry what they mean). 
			What;s important is that when you pass that object to the constructor function of J3D.Mesh it will interpret it and 
			create initialize model in the engine.</p>
			
			<p>By now we have a shape of an object, and a position in space where we want it to be. The next thing we need is to declare what
			our 3d object will look like. In 3d terms this is often refered to as material. In J3D we use a slightly different term and call it
			renderer.</p>
			
			<pre class="brush: js; first-line: 4">
			t.renderer = new J3D.Normal2Color();</pre>
			
			<p>Normal2Color is a very simple renderer. It takes the direction in which sides of a model are facing and renders it as a color, 
			giving the object a nice pastel tint. It is not terribly useful in real life scenarios, but it allows to quickly preview an object 
			and is great for debugging.</p>
